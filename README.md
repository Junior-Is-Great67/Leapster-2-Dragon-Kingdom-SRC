# Leapster2's Dragon Kingdom Source
 The Source Code For A Special 2009 Promo McDonalds Hosted Using A Leapster2 Flash Emulator.

# To Do:
- Fix full screening as it broke during decompiling
- Get rid of unused scripts/debugging swfs
- Fix Missing Fonts

# Requirements
- Adobe Flash CS5 or newer

## Reminders
- You cant open this in Adobe Animate bc they dropped as1/as2 support
- This could break if it doesnt find all the swfs so in short just dont delete anything
